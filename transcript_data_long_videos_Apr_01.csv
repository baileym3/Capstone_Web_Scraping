2,SHH1vWD19Fw,thank coming back tuesday th february reports deaths united states vaccinations concerned answer ill ill show similar data uk smaller nbers im concerned ill tell im concerned pity anti-vaxxers sort latching using purposes stick us ill tell im concerned bit embarrassing actually videos sometimes make little mistakes well yesterday made quite big one im going correct apologize incompetence say become aware mistakes report back also appreciate people written essentially peer reviewers lets look nature mistake yesterdays paper yesterday talked year old year old man immuno-competent mistakenly said immunocompromised combination dyslexia incompetence clear paper severe infection south african variant v case report kind screenshot proves wrong paper immunocompetent virus wasnt sick got re-infected despite immunocompetent normal immune system far know hiv yet got really quite sick second time around change bit one things worried possibility antibody dependent enhancement know written concerns case antibody dependent enhancement antibody dependent enhancement occurs example occur hiv extent classic condition occurs dengue fever someones much sicker second time four different serotypes get get second different form antibodies produce first form actually helps virus get cells second time around going problem south africa variant concern well answer dont think something need keep eye cases start popping europe concern want keep eye theoretical problem reason dont think practical problem moment south africa data south africa actually happened things going quite well uk around time time uk got uk variant south africa got south africa variant south africa variant cases south africa thankfully control south africa caused increased transmissibility virus far know doesnt cause increased morbidity mortality doesnt make people sicker make people die somewhat inconsistent report france let reiterate south africa data cases south africa theyre deaths know theyre going much would like yet classic delay see debts south africa keep going cases kept going therefore k th deaths south africa continue go well happen south african situation left bit mystery person sick second time around know wasnt caused immunocompromised immunocompetent sorry confusion hope cleared actually deepens mystery raises concern slightly weve said cons reassured south africa data following trajectories would would like know quite keeping eye open cases reinfection course rare keeping eye concern next mistake want correct relatively well minor one pretty minor one actually mixed convergent evolution last week co-evolution whats difference got great relevance pandemic convergent evolution get evolution two lineages example could evolution birds completely separate mammals birds probably came dinosaurs people think days birds develop wings also mammals develop wings theyre called bats wings wings come arisen via two completely separate evolutionary lineages yet wing solve problem i.e fly arisen twice evolutionary history convergent evolution co-evolution two things evolve together example parasites hosts might evolve together predators prey might evolve together evolution one affects evolution important well conversion convergent evolution important example ny mutation south africa uk variant variant mutant variation spike protein receptor binding domain virus arisen completely separately obviously mutation occurs selective advantage likely selected likely become predominant strain south africa variant south africa uk variant uk also reassuring given one arisen twice means probably limited amounts mutations efficacious organism evolutionary theory lots lots mutations happens time mutations going time vast majority deleterious well-being propagation organism occasionally beneficial mutation comes along selected actually think amount possible beneficial mutations size coronavirus going limited course also know vaccine people rapidly adapt vaccine account convergent evolution right lets take first five minutes pence lets go todays topic really quite serious ive got emails people comments people basically alarmed genuinely alarmed vaccine adverse events reporting system united states actually similar system looking uk called yellow card system looking data vaccine adverse events reporting system first important note anyone file report anyone whether theyve vaccine strict rules penalties people submit false claims im saying false claims probably legitimate reports course good vaccine adverse events reporting system part cdc fda officially set body think set probably something memory anyway data th december th february time know way million doses covered vaccine administered united states ran cant dont know say anyway vaccination adverse events reporting system received reports deaths people died well thousand people died shortly receiving vaccine arent concerned well . receive vaccine cdc food drug administration physicians review case report death soon notified cdc requests medical records assess reports remember course people vaccinated first elderly risk vaccinated first course part life people often die frequently probability surviving year goes quite substantially proportion vulnerable people elderly people die theyve received vaccine surprising would died whether theyd receive vaccine know well reported review available clinical information carried physicians cdc fda get information look death certificates look autopsy reports dont autopsies united kingdom england scotland wales island post-mortems post post personal death thing basically get body examine work cause death bits bobs take account medical records way post-mortem information autopsy report accurate diagnosis possibly get youre actually looking diseased organ medical records bottom line revealed link vaccinations take elderly group people take million surprising normal cycle life die within relatively short period time specific point time talking happens point time vaccinated reflects cycle life reflect problem vaccine cdc fda continue investigate reports adverse events including deaths reported call vaccine adverse event reporting system going carry ongoing surveillance screen anyone put form cdc commented quite specifically detail lets look theyve said try focus bit cdc site weve looked check covered vaccine safe effective italics direct quotes cd site cdc site millions people united states received covered vaccine vaccine undergo intensive safety monitoring u.s history done quiet done incompetently done massive massive follow-up united states well see uk well course developed countries cdc recommends get copy vaccine soon eligible italics going disagree cdc fda federal parties continue monitor safety covered vaccine hundreds people died taking vaccine yes concern people older vulnerable groups us anyway part natural cycle life want put way died vaccine vaccine vaccine according cdc investigation uk dont dont vaccine adverse events reporting system whats called yellow card system course computers old days used literally yellow cards still called yellow card system doctor pharmacist nurse indeed member public anyone file report yellow card scheme well reviewed adverse reaction drug vaccine main difference us uk system american one vaccine adverse events reporting system seems specific vaccine whereas uk kind wrap together medicines well end results situation uk lot unexpected deaths vaccine uk well course deaths vaccine uk none linked vaccine nothing worry lets look detail convince site uk go peruse coronavirus vaccine weekly smary yellow card reporting last updated th february expect another update th february looking days time gives lots valuable information particular interest follow ill tell bits think relevant reassurance looking particular video vaccine single effective way reduce deaths severely austin covered direct quote nber nature suspected adverse reactions reported far unusual comparison types routinely used vaccine would expect new vaccine overall safety experience vaccine far expected clinical trials says vaccine uk talking oxford astrazeneca pfizer bioentech whereas states course modern national institutes health fighter bioentec based current experience expected benefits covid vaccine preventing covid serious complications far outweigh known side effects someone says want vaccine bite hand say america youre states youre enthusiastic something england know someone offers nut something take nut bite hand well bizarre quite bizarre expression really go vaccine medicines safety covered vaccine continuously monitored idea dped public national agencies watching like hawks ridiculous actively monitored okay websites updated weekly think reassured reports dealt immediately united states uk come events fatal outcome site uk site based age stratified cause causes death mortality england wales several thousand deaths expected occurred naturally within seven days many millions doses vaccine administered far bearing mind started highly vulnerable groups exactly united states data would expect natural cycle life word naturally key word medicines healthcare regulatory authority uk fires bio end tech uk reported patients died shortly vaccine oxford . dont really see difference nbers probably remember pfizer bioentech vaccine giving first dont give data terms percentages vaccine doses given give nbers surprising starting roll one right major illnesses majority elderly underlying illnesses people vaccinated elderly underlying illnesses review individual reports suggest fact vaccine played role death like states nbers said well probably kind acceptable one looked reviewed adjudicated vaccine cause death deaths within week week week quite sure time uk week think longer states think might three weeks something deaths deaths whatever two three weeks vaccine doesnt surprise mortal caused vaccine according expert opinion something could hide something going wasnt fully reported early stage would unimaginable unimaginable later believe im im time conspiracy theories data transparent publicly available good news scott morrison people people week going vaccinated end february kicking next couple weeks mr morrison prime minister course wants week february end february going march early march expect people week vaccinated wonderful country australia greg hunt minister health expects go million doses week end march april expect million doses million doses per week march million per week april want population australia six months hopefully pfizer approved last month course fires bio anti-vaccine approved last month european people european union well ive said theyre embarrassed lack vaccine provision people people raging understandably talk expert ban said export ban exports vaccine declared transparent anyway bottom line australians reassured vaccine fisa vaccine pre-ordered produced europe flown australia course means less vaccine left europe million doses arrive australia doses landed last monday starting vaccinate next monday nd february nd february v day australia nd feb important day australian history great bit later would wanted know theyre starting border force officers outbreaks noticed melbourne situation hotel quarantine workers kind makes sense likely die agk residents workers makes sense giving link australian priority groups good news australia mean april may june july august september everyone australia vaccinated september obviously vulnerable first yeah great fantastic good good news approved oxford australians approved oxford astrazeneca vaccine yesterday think yesterday anyway theyve secured . million doses good plus million say million doses gives men population billion theyve got enough havent theyve got enough vaccine pfizer oxford theyve got enough excellent see local production melbourne going produce million melbourne one things learned pandemic im sure come every country want make sure in-country vaccine production facility lesson canada learning speak facility already melbourne repurposed million vaccine kind produced vaccine australians get going oxford australians end authorizing body australia therapeutic goods administration didnt know tga approve theyve approved use people age say demonstrate strong immune response course know meeting boss vaccine agency germany france day-to-day activities let know dont seem work bit direct quote demonstrate strong immune response theyre saying case case basis lets give bit courage courage convictions go data evidence showing strong immune response go evidence follow evidence wherever leads even leads saying british vaccine works really well french one doesnt work well even evidence leads follow leads know way around french vaccine sanofi would absolutely brilliant oxford would want rubbish well supporting know evidence leads save many lives quickly possible scope jingoism apparage limit australian vaccine officially good two doses ah interesting want weeks apart ox oxford vaccine especially well oxford vaccine talking specifically havent seen australian data published australian intentions published far apart want fisa vaccine said want oxford astrazeneca vaccine weeks apart primary dose booster dose absolute minim minim four weeks reason shouldnt longer even remote parts australia far see course oxford vaccine mean australians live cities shouldnt problem freezer supply fisa vaccine kept super cool temperatures still hassle whereas oxford astrozenica vaccine shipped around australia normal refrigerated conditions stored ages fridge go alice springs kept normal fridge people vaccinated around minimal difficulty oxford vaccine much usable doesnt need super cold conditions fisa vaccine five priority groups australia identified want look detail theyre pretty well youd expect vital workers likely die catch covered . think say today really think maybe mention one thing deaths talked mentioned really deaths occurred covered vaccine deaths caused quite deaths caused covered vaccine takes two three weeks generate immune response someone first vaccinated protection day covered day okay maybe exactly scientifically true need look fact week asse immunity cover day vaccine need wait full three weeks immunological benefit kick tragic quite people die ive covered got vaccine still waiting immune processes develop said governments tell us otherwise must behave exactly way post-vaccination vaccine precautions still obeyed normal australia talking bit green passports australian government talking john says green passports happen inevitable lot people dont like idea see quite quite inevitable okay think us today lets end sarah soon good memories might remember sarah centers quite exquisite artwork somehow sarah sue managed get vaccinated time asse sue underlying condition clearly older daughter ladies great news delighted hope join soon yet okay us today reassured vaccine way pandemic dont listen mbo jbo none evidence-based naysayers unless come firm evidence far havent ill first tell havent contrary contrary evidence vaccine safe efficacious thank watching

close mind completely willing listen think science dies say well government consensus scientific consensus well closing scientific mind recipe disaster science also ad hominem attacks attacking panel without listening leaving huff questions shows small-mindedness closed-mindedness really everything avoid im advocate one treatment ask tough questions panel im open-minded enough listen side see try determine whether good treatment bad immediately close mind think bad way looking good friend die yesterday im one whos saying isnt deadly disease lived couple doors sad kelly sad happened six months ago friend died disease lack stress ekg died terminal arrhythmia two young children stress ekg canceled government decided shouldnt elective procedure delayed died terminal arrhythmia people also die decisions people make important thing one person right panelists right people question go back forth try figure truth mistake say one person power determine place much confidence government doctors dr fauci dr corey mentioned mentioned june steroids mentioned march dr fauci came committee hearing first thought final pathway covid end stages dissimilar final pathways adult respiratory distress syndrome friend whos surgeon got strep-eating flesh operating somebody blood splatter got chance losing limbs like percent like chance losing limbs devastating disease one final common pathways like covet blood vessels leak fluid lungs sort toxic shock kind syndrome treated high dose steroids raised hand dr fausch said think steroids might role sort dismissed said studies showing probably wouldnt work would think people would argue one significant developments acute care covid patient steroids actually trying get steroids theyve gotten full ards syndrome even getting early stage disease came people asking questions skeptical letting one doctor dr fauci say oh right young man go sit corner need open mind im saying im always right im bystander im expert try ask important questions one questions id like ask think difficulty proving situation either ivermectin hydro hydroxychlor hydroxycorquin many people get better know control group might people get better give hydroxycorquin group might get . going difficult thing actually prove trials get benefit sounds like sicker patients mortality know mortality sound significant youre getting sicker patients outpatient studies one critiques many people get better naturally proven statistically significant comes mind sort like wanted prove aspirin taking aspirin day good prevent heart attacks took like years know people study hard show differences whether aspirin worked think thing true either hydroxychloroquine ivermectin outpatient setting many people get better converse youre really sick almo hard get treat people sick hard prove anything works people sick guess id like open panel one one explain answer critique mostly paper people getting better anyway youve proven treatment works group people didnt go hospital youre selecting actually people may well know prevent getting seriously sick selected patient pool theyre outpatient tending people gonna get better dont well start well start dr oscar well go dr corey let quick interject low participation take whatever time whatever questions dr thank much senator paul appreciate introduction im politician im trader ill practical ill defer dr corey experience intensivist clinical approach patients symptoms treat early typically risk stratify patients getting ldh levels lymphocyte counts blood panels whenever possible ive used hydroxychloroquine ive oftentimes cybermechtin ive patients go hospital didnt ekg another good assessment ive always clinically evaluated patients ive treated risk stratified may may know husband-and-wife couple know dr john senator johnson knows treated wife husband didnt deem husband sick enough warrant treatment although perfectly safe wife much sicker think degree left discretionary clinicians terms data provided clerk committee ms kilbride pdfs nerous clinical trials many drugs limited including hydroxychloroquine iremectin vitamin zinc medications trials fact weve third world countries second world countries innovative outperformed us terms survival think something warrants questioning one wonder bloated research academic bureaucracy excuse hindrance help healthcare crisis ill turn whomever hope satisfactory dr corey senator paul appreciate question critical content question tell somethings working many patients get better one answer know one central tenets science need control group need group comparable treat compare dont treat trying message today manuscript randomized controlled trials every one controlled trials show ivermectin treated group lives saved less need hospitalization less transmission less case counts fundamentally powerfully effective therapy covet . need nih review data data let say amount patients randomized control trials trials total nearly half treated ivermectin lets remind treatment covert fundamentally changed recovery trial announced june trial patients treated steroids showed dramatic life-saving properties corticosteroids almost overnight treatment covert changed result trial recovery trial presenting paper today patients treated ivermectin larger magnitudes benefit recovery trial maintain ivermectin standard care disease based data opinion data data give anyone else placebo based data manuscript believe would malpractice lead heightened risk death placebo needed studies inpatient inpatient outpatient vary randomized control trials almost cant describe data shows people need read manuscript four randomized control trials prophylaxis every one highly statistically significant patients people even citizens healthy citizens ivermectin get cold youre comparing placebo studies youre considering yes prophylaxis studies alone four took covet patients tested positive covert identified household members gave ivermectin whole group household contacts covet patients took ivermectin households didnt give ivermectin every single randomized controlled trial shows households ivermectin drastically reduced rates transmission households get sick protect people disease ivermectin prophylaxis trials outpatient trials outcome tested many people positive turned positive positive many people got symptoms drastically statistically significant multiple centers countries around world prophylaxis also trials early outpatient well hospital dramatic hospital almost every single one four large randomized controlled trials hospital statistically significant reductions mortality dr reiter large observational control trial broward county hes panel today trial also showed patients got ivermectin died far less rates opponents using ivermect responded critiqued generalized argent make silence opponents want call attention nih recommendation dont say theyre opponent made last recommendation ivermectin august th either years ago four months ago dont know august th recommendation recommend use ivermectin outside clinical trials recommendation based expert opinion data recommend recommend expert opinion well ill happy join chairman sending letter try get evaluation could go question weve got time actually get better also start dr reiter thank allowing speak clarify something people talk asymptomatic patients kind stopped using nomenclature call pre-symptomatic patients know offhand one asymptomatic patients going develop severe disease become symptomatic problem nber one problem nber two put written testimony also early testimony talk early intervention treatment decrease viral shedding viral transmission home setting currently believed largest nbers people getting infected getting infected home setting means year old may fine comes christmas family meeting asymptomatic individual infects family members including year old grandma real problem know ivermectin literally destroys virus people within hours hence take somebody asymptomatic carrier risk transmission essentially stop right tracks dont issue person contaminating people line significantly decrease risk really even different spin question asked continue far data youre right senator difficult team currently study place protocols written ready go limiting factor get funding ive tried everywhere getting funding extremely difficult need large study large randomized control study confirm findings prove naysayers know golden standard study observational study propensity matched highest standard non-randomized control trial even shows tremendous benefit spoke reduction overall mortality donkeys well look overall mortality people severe lung involvement went percent even dramatic decrease even severe individuals safe drug track record phenomenal . billion doses administered think need studies help nih cdc one regulatory agencies study like could implemented within days within another days could collected data within another two three weeks able answers things moved forward regulatory agencies couldnt answers strategy even worsens dr balboni great thank thank senator paul question think ill speak trials running peer broad spectr antiviral targeting rna dependent rna polymerase running currently two large placebo-controlled randomized phase three trials outpatient setting early treatment close exposure prophylaxis addition two phase twos one stanford outpatient setting long-term care well observational studies thousands data points hundreds smaller trials run many countries around world need develop hybrid trial methodologies combine traditional rcts observational study designs gather real world evidence regulators dont cool data going see kovid rear view mirror going quickly forget potential treatments going fall wayside agree need gather data large populations make commitment way make studies work true public-private partnership single companies weve heard dont ability incentive run trials revere way patent risk consorti little support kind work soon falls away weve got beholden shareholders boards meantime physician im trying right thing patients need assistance need government help whole government approach commitment going beyond immediate problem pressing faces right thing long haul gather data silence silence criticisms kinds studies multiple small studies wont work correctly point need gather data bundle together make available future outbreaks last thing ill say part trials true look mortality data trials would unacceptably large would take long run working regulators look time resolution symptoms similar done also tamivir tamiflu believe stepwise approach taking long dont whole government approach problem ask committee present decided ask questions please internalize message need whole government approach similar done vaccine gather data exactly said get large populations show difference next doctor orion see senator holly computer going check see whether wants ask questions dr orient want answer question senator paul excellent question certainly applies types research would say really sick patient sense controlled historical control patient patient going downhill something patient gets better evidence maybe something right hand patient pretty well something patient suddenly gets worse worried might caused problem patient bunch patients healthy theyre going well matter guess really need large study looks like ivermectin done course many confounding variables ethical questions something going protect grandma works nothing going put grandma risk engaging kind han sacrifice use placebo point become thing people even suggested maybe rct outdated looking statistical approaches like bayesian analysis get good data without running ethical ethical dilemma deal need maybe combination therapies deal confounding variables dr bhattacharya thank senator paul question mean think gist question right outcome relatively rare yeah need large samples order test whether control group test whether treatment actually works get indication observational studies difficulties treatment randomly assigned statistical methods address great advantage observational studies statistical methods correcting sort selection bias treatment actually get large samples relatively inexpensively procedure think could follow mean could could use data sets like medicare claims data claims data sets readily available large-scale data sets check sort well-designed observational settings facial studies see promising know promise kinds treatments people thinking could many many many treatments principle know lots people different ideas check use inform large trial run mean think one procedure others one potentially could follow key thing want get across possible choose incentives great result much less information probably effectiveness various treatments know proposed time part also think driven group think mentioned decided small set things going work even evidence evaluated think regretted think go back principles know sound science works look control groups studies incentives run studies else theyre going get done senator holly well check staff know one thing think lose discussions observational versus iran control studies difference pandemic situation non-pandemic situation youve got off-the-shelf drugs prescribed safely decades kind like give shot mean com completely different mindset went way senator hawley thanks joining hearing go ahead yeah thank mr chairman thanks holding hearing doctor teriya could first pronouncing name right anybody fine thanks okay thank indulgent want ask points made written testimony thought quite striking challenges mitigation strategies particularly mitigation strategies involve lockdowns full lockdowns course experienced virtually every part country certainly home state earlier year many advocating mitigation strategy write data consequences social isolation deteriorating mental health associated lockdowns particularly struck cdc data cite says let get right one four young adults seriously considered suicide past june much country locked really stunning nber impacts talk testimony really stunning speak challenges maybe young people particular americans face lockdowns mitigation strategy think think lockdowns mitigation strategy failure map policy imagination absolutely devastating effects hans meant live isolation main focus lockdown strategies think folks higher risk disease said older people people chronic conditions instance deaths happen nursing homes actually need sort isolation careful well increase dementia related deaths nursing homes apart covid key key failure think failure public health recognize dangers covet heart disease psychology psychological distress young people devastating basically made feel guilty even normal young people things mean result see one four seriously considered suicide nber absolutely shocking mean think shocked imagination everyone listening thinking creatively policy alternatives lockdown lockdown last-ditch effort thing decided time noticed even world health organization say body place little trust given conduct pandemic little respect nonetheless even believe said mass lockdowns mitigation strategy dont recommend mean quite contrary think consequences youve outlined lockdowns devastating yeah mean think estimate un put april actually think saying million people risk starvation consequence economic damage epidemic mean lives million mean know two orders magnitude nber people died kovac . account policy response think utterly irresponsible talk little bit health care effects associated lockdowns decisions cancel elective surgeries know home state missouri many hospitals canceled elective surgeries back spring trying prepare based data time thought would absolutely massive surge even seeing cases rising quite significantly across country home state nber hospitals precaution curbed elective surgeries cases delay totally understand help us speak could issues come problem deferred health care especially lockdown situation many tens thousands americans millions americans may deferring would otherwise fairly routine health care procedures health care visits culative effect weeks months built going paying total gent long time take one example striking mammography mammograms check breast cancer declined think something percent nationwide whats consequence many many women would diagnosed earlier stage breast cancers come late stage breast cancers next year weve actually made lot progress reversing mortality breast cancer cancers last decade going get reversed certainty basic preventative measures colonoscopies mammography gone wayside covet mean think mean clear coveted lockdowns think public health think public health health simply one disease public health infection control think major mistake weve made pandemic good thank dr corey could ask question two social media wrote testimony noticed one barriers using already existing therapeutics whatever may array social media say pages particular repeatedly blocked facebook wonder could elaborate experience facebook social media topic yeah know want try respectful think intention correct execution unfortunately damaging guess social media outlets particular facebook want cut misinformation right many doctors claiming x z work disease challenge youre also silencing us expert reasoned researched extremely knowledgeable group facebook page repeat highly published physicians specialty weve spent know decades academic medicine random doctor group every time mention ivermectin weve put facebook jail currently moment facebook page shut point cannot post anything weve asked senator help trying disseminate expert opinion heavily researched insights therapeutics disease unable social media reason dr corey reason given putting facebook jail dont know weve gotten specific reasons best tell mentioning ivormectin claims simple solution way im going stand professional reputation decades medicine im going tell believe believe group doctors least nine us co-authored manuscript telling world solution covet implemented rapidly however social media want hear doctors dont blame otherwise youre going doctors coming along saying know dont know soda water next solution understand intent however wish credibility would applied us dont know solve answer think misinformation problem deep significant problem pandemic however propagators misinformation facebook staffed expert epidemiologists infectious disease researchers knowledge knowledge certainly mean facebook arbiter counts medical research opinion course dont think arbiters im trying fair think intent protect people misinformation however also blocking good information hard filter put understand challenge wish better right well thank dr corey thank work thank sharing unfortunately pattern see facebook social media giants decided arbiters information news journalism rest united states determine counts accurate reliable news research everything else despite usually zero expertise areas way zero desire american public deciding read conse learn share really unbelievable mr chairman thank much holding hearing well thank senator holly participating want go dr ryder whos treated patients hospital hospital also outpatient describe han terms happens covid patient think one heartbreaking aspects disease quite honestly one reasons know people get tested dont want become coveted patient dont want separated family describe whats happened know people dying alone continue necessary describe happens somebody going hospital take yes sir thank senator let talk specific patient specific example vivid mind talk loud lady came significant medical problems believe slight hypertension diabetes everything well controlled lady initially diagnosed called presented room air within hours ended two liters worth oxygen point got consulted help management course next hours lady went two liters oxygen way percent oxygen rapid decline time hospital lockdown meaning visitors allowed hospital lady knew things going badly medical staff limiting access rooms limited ppe supplies disease well aware quite critical family bedside limited interaction healthcare workers nurses entering room looking im like bad news based experience lady would facing near certain intubation back april intubation meant chance dying call son gets ipad room facetime discussion point sun broke tears like doctor youve got something got got doctors always something im like sir respect nothing else offer luckily wife also doctor dr sapillowicz writer read article dr wagstaff australia day know patients family pleading im like know one hope dont know clinical data dosing trial something administer hans toxic like indications right im like yes started talking indications said know give shot try please beg try got informed consent informed consent administered drug allowed establish connectivity family luckily lady well get intubated went oxygen subsequently improved discharged home maybe week later see social isolation people away family even today today visitors allowed back hospital allowed coveted rooms means patients away family measures healthcare workers need take even still policy limiting entry room example nurse group lab draws medications try enter room maybe three four times day residents part institution ask enter room going one two physicians going physical exam taken physicians usually im one physicians enter room patients expose isolating people know besides medical problems covet causes kidney problems heart problem lung problems also know creates tremendous amount problems mental status people mind quite right seen tremendous amount anxiety yes emotionally draining patients families frankly healthcare workers know young family young wife children end day want go home safe become major proponent early treatment early treatment expose healthcare workers including staff unnecessarily people admitted hospital advanced disease feel critical early intervention know treatment works much better earlier later even later see data published results quite staggering dr ryder made pretty pretty convincing case standpoint concentrate early treatments avoid type han toll dr orient one reasons contacted got contact became aware dr lee vliet early advocating early treatment particular hydroxychloroquine organization allowed get think like doctors quickly signing letter sent president united states encouraging know something allow doctors access types drugs use label prescription rights think one thing always impressed organization aaps pretty simple mission statement first describe also youre hearing network doctors courage compassion treat patients early basically know answer question asked dr reiter know happening covet patients better approach well aaps founded preserve private medicine means physician working good patients like says oath hippocrates good organization society political party advancement science individual patient doctors first priority doctor authority go along responsibility patient look best best methods communicate colleagues sometimes lot times guess whats best thing patient keep careful watch works best found physicians independent practice able doctor employer managed care plan hes restricted whats drop-down menu hands really tied nih authority employer respects goes outside rules matter much patient needs hes putting life risk becoming used worry practice liability minor thing compared period hospital way get rid destroys whole career forever licensure board deviated standard care used determined doctors similar situation rational well-trained people would dictated single authorities high whos whose opinions keep getting carried along like ama arizona medical association im learning ivermectin arizona medical association army county medical society ama say nothing ask doctors answer well nothing recommended fda patient independent doctor quite much severe restrictions extremely important occasionally patient tell well begged pleaded hospital person patient husband dying please please well give intravenous vitamin c sometimes patients suggestion works mean doesnt always doctors afraid dare something even safe even critically trialled reported literature even long time ago lose job every incentive say well nothing keeping keeping option open patients extremely important thank dr orient know championed right try know dr reiter basically practiced mean patient something patient patients son begged something something think exactly right certainly seeing different type medical establishment fewer doctors practicing medicine associated hospitals follow protocols makes perfect sense pandemic think outside box things dr balboni want ask thought phone conversation sunday pretty interesting youve youve youve fda youve physician department defense youve government youre youre outside really want ask two questions one describe government doesnt incentive run trials know private sector doesnt cost millions millions dollars generic drug incentive government nih cdc fda advocates citizens patients regardless know financial incentive look repurposing drugs describe occur one things talked know drugs tool kit pandemic know think dr fauci talked hydroxychloroquine drug company trying go trial kind toolkit designed pandemics sudden hit covet like toolbox drawer shut locked ignored kind describe process lack incentives sure great great question ill ill try uproar utmost respect colleagues former colleagues government think end day people trying right thing say sometimes doesnt always work way question working fab appearability first saw part ebola outbreak showed effect treating ebola everyone kind forgot pressure move quickly went away approved pandemic flu japan approved kobit india russia likely approved japan covet imminently fda moving quickly although fruitful discussions think treating unfortunately many products chronic diseases may work well non-pandemic situation structure organizations review thoughtfully take time look look data im suggesting dont addition push agencies forcing function change stress think fall back know reviewing approving drugs like cardiovascular drugs take time think needs forcing function supporting efforts move outside tried true review process think committee politicians hands lever whether policy law needs forcing function move ways things work non-pandemic situation would point two things senator public law worked inside dod law signed effect mandates dod fda hold discussions talks around regulated products particular interest warfighter puts accelerated approval track doesnt cut corners allows regulators devote resources kinds accelerated discussions would also point recent development politics notwithstanding shouldnt matter pragmatic approach kinds photos morning yeah lets go business gotta see mans gonna know know dont think dont think gave like tearing process apart im pretty calm points wow music nice meet yes nice finally meet know whos sitting look oh courtney okay great thank know dont quite match like thought cold wanted heat things little bit cold youre right anything cold walking across bridge parking lot culture

unfortunately also hosting great pleasure welcome dr samantha van der slott oxford martin fellow program collective responsibility infectious disease also oxford vaccine research group minutes strictly us little bit dialogue q q available ask question function bottom right hand screen please type questions without ado move ten minute minute presentation argents favor mandatory vaccination let get im going start two assptions make debate interesting first enough vaccine go around everyone would benefit secondly mandatory vaccination going advantage alternative policies voluntary vaccination really interesting debate enough vaccination vaccine fact voluntary vaccination fastest way get herd immunity interesting issue comes mandatory vaccination going offer us benefits costs peoples liberty general ethical principle state use coercion prevent threat one person harming another example child goes school bottle toxic bleach gun bleach gun removed child child might harm others infectious disease case microscopic potentially lethal threats one individual asymptomatic potentially kill others restricting threat coercion justified lockdown quarantine also mandatory vaccination another aspect argent mandatory vaccination pandemic time lives every day around world people die covert . every day delay getting herd immunity another people around world die matter getting herd immunity matter getting quickly possible estimates put somewhere percent population needs immunize immunised create herd immunity considerable evidence case covert greater usual vaccine hesitancy recent poll united states indicates half population wont take vaccine similarly research kings college london shows half uk population likely certain take new vaccine mean takes longer get herd immunity important recognize mandatory vaccination would anything new many mandatory policies coercive policies taxes form coercion seatbelts originally voluntary made mandatory reduced risk death wearer also occupants car importantly people die seat belt injuries benefits vastly outweigh risks countries world already mandatory vaccination policies australia jab pay policy involves withholding child care benefits child isnt vaccinated italy fines u.s children cant attend school unless theyre vaccinated policies increased vaccination rates implementable important recognize mandatory vaccination necessarily mean holding somebody forcibly vaccinating means attaching cost vaccinated example italy think fines euros us homeschool child costs reasonable mandatory vaccination acceptable people benefits individual others four factors need considered deciding whether vaccination mandatory first grave problem serious secondly whats level confidence vaccine safe effective thirdly better alternative strategies including voluntary incentivized vaccination lastly costs proportionate gravity problem safety efficacy vaccine ill talk little four factors bad covert well thered million deaths worldwide deaths uk covert killing people lockdown government requires absence vaccination one leaked report puts non-covered lives lost result lockdown mention billion euros measures far clocked infection fatality rate still clear ranges somewhere . . . percent many people judge significantly high infection fatality rate course argents covert grave enough warrant mandatory vaccination even sweden mandatory lockdown highest all-cause death rate sweden pandemic similar actually surpassed years months nber excess deaths uk still level . think debatable whether covert severe enough fairly clear lockdown appears necessary governments point view imposing grave costs vaccination said boris johnson way safe vaccine well trials yet complete reasons question whether covert vaccine safe enough made mandatory first decade work compressed year never vaccine coronavirus mrna adenovirus vaccine new vaccine new biological intervention carries unforeseen risks vaccine said safe take months years see rare side effects emerge many hundreds thousands people administer vaccine uncertainty also important compare mandatory vaccination relevant alternatives controlling infection include voluntary vaccination incentivized vaccination purposes argent im going asse manatee vaccination confers benefits lastly costs need proportionate gravity problem safety efficacy vaccine modest fines withholding certain benefits may proportionate unlikely imprisonment compulsory vaccination would justified important compare loss freedom mandatory vaccination would involve loss freedom weve already experienced lockdown quarantine one argents often given choose least restrictive alternative weak principle means two alternatives equally likely bring beneficial effect issue infringe freedom greater benefit proportionality key mandatory vaccination easy rescue cost small relative collective benefit ethically justified three reasons think mandatory vaccination covert might justified first need get herd immunity fast protect people get lockdown need protect vulnerable people cant vaccinated medical reasons allergies immune problems illnesses require herd immunity require others vaccinated order protected many diseases influenza influenza elderly dont mount strong immune response influenza like covert primarily disease elderly lethal case elderly best way protect elderly influenza vaccinate vaccinate health care workers vaccinate children super spread influenza mount good immune responses whether covert like influenza remains seen appears vaccine effective elderly people appears children super spreaders certain conditions may vaccination whole population necessary achieve sufficient herd immunity immunity also wounds time makes necessary much higher levels vaccination mandatory vaccination conclusion certainly ethically justified basis preventing harm others reduces transmission infection also justified protect nhs enormous pressure people becoming sick justified herd immunity required bring country lockdown protect population thank ill pass okay end presentation clara colleague samantha give argents mandatory vaccination covert . thank much im going switch screen okay im going making argent mandatory vaccination course quite binary way thinking problem raise vaccine uptake question whether introduce mandatory vaccination doesnt seem go away huge appeal media debate topic actually something politicians like talk ill go present case mandatory vaccination dont think good idea im going highlight historical context fed public policy responses impact recent outbreaks worldwide prospects covert vaccination starting politicians saying matt hancock uk health secretary last year already said im seriously looking moment said hes ruling scott morrison whos australian prime minister said would expect mandatory possibly make said morning afternoon actually said cant hold someone take really response backlash received saying mandatory finally john dora whos sao paulo governor said sao paulo mandatory except medical note certificate saying cannot put opposition also told didnt authority make decision bolsonaro make think politicians tend like idea mandatory vaccination shows taking strong line also appealing appears solve problem low vaccination quite easily without put much cost resources get high impact also know historical examples always case particularly compulsory vaccination early smallpox countries also good time make distinctions compulsory mandatory vaccination julian hinted scale cohesiveness talking monitoring compulsory theyre used interchangeably compulsory tends attached legal efforts see picture policeman victorian image england law enforcing vaccination criminalized face punishment mandatory vaccination refers sorts requirements might financial incentives disincentives access public goods like education early compulsory vaccination though concern coercive provoked organized matter resistance movements many countries including england netherlands places like england reverted back making vaccination voluntary recommended vaccination people still need encouraged vaccinate theyre going without prompt england wha working group actually put quite concisely call three cs factors influence vaccination includes complacency convenience confidence complacency feeling safe risk perhaps vaccination meant diseases arent seen moment conveniences easy feasible vaccinated weve got confidence trust vaccine safety people behind vaccination uk nhs campaigns tackle three cs services policy education persuasion countries also followed similar suit led quite high uptake rates vaccination think really crucial balancing two groups society designing policies take account two groups might call passive compliers active resistors simplifying slightly delivered institutions youre catering two sections society heaven policies coercive enough encourage coercive enough provoke resistance see mandatory vaccination policy really overshooting undershooting balance think manageable vaccination provocative group know resist grow larger provocation people moving passive compliers active resistors influence might call hesitant group grow reaction kind policies okay fine policies dont work well enough weve seen vaccine preventable disease outbreaks recently measles us response outbreaks mandatory vaccination school entry already removed non-medical exemptions certain states including california . italy mandatory vaccination rules strengthened france also managed vaccination one vaccine also included recommended vaccine previous years samoa big measles outbreak made vaccination mandatory state emergency lastly germany made measles mandatory school attendance medicare measles vaccination ask policies work yes see upward trend later figures see vaccination rates going want make two points counter behind vaccine uptake optics might seem apparent first point think hard separate impact policies ways around mandatory vaccination policy might hidden data wont go detail see america two earlier policies seen impact higher uptake possibly already making difference exemptions vaccinations werent medical passed senate bill second point think also crucial mandatory vaccination doesnt address underlying causes vaccine hesitancy refusal could result backlashes ive gone lead unintended consequences like inequity education cant go school also look countries manage achieve high uptake without mandatory vaccination like sweden think look mandatory vaccination worldwide mixed picture doesnt really respond high uptake vaccination right end story think concession would give degree mandatoryness could possible without blanket policy think could apply particular sections economy society conditional basis travel weve seen recent announcement qantas boss saying covered vaccine mandatory passengers think situations might put place examples flu healthcare workers asked vaccinate also yellow fever vaccine passport countries high risk yellow tuber transmission time think need think policies increasing ive mentioned three cs involving public along process also ask coercive policies actually necessary think indications uk support current vaccine badly countries percent sorry percent saying would totally agree vaccine fallen cause concern see protest picture protests lockdown rules already protests native mandatory vaccine think raising red flag ball introducing policy like know opposition already end want end prime minister boris johnson point also isnt situation mandatory vaccination nothing think needs happening concerted campaign engagement public communication covert vaccine includes answering questions concerns people might new vaccine necessarily needing coercive definitely dont think straightforward description boris johnson given yeah would recommend focusing mandatory delicate situation communicating thanks much sam fantastic think program says well ask questions know minutes general discussion let ask one major kind argents mandatory vaccination increase resistance vaccination far know know group population somewhere around five percent clearly resistant vaccination resistant mandatory policy swing voters describe far im aware evidence countries introduced mandatory policies people gone anti-vaccination movement aware empirical evidence people move anti-vaccination stance made new know people currently well move yeah youre right lack evidence think examples provided new mandatory vaccination requirements especially europe going take time see impact yeah especially youre thinking countries across board one vaccination say us talking ridiculous states tightening vaccine requirements policies happened last one two three years think seeing arctic resistance vaccination policies isnt hasnt extreme way might happen time think worry weve seen growing increase okay things wanted ask ask another question yeah kind connected im worried harmful effects least restrictive alternative doesnt seem take account might harmful effects policy intervention considering benefits impression would different way youre completely right need consider harmful effects flow effects vaccine impact vaccine hesitancy yes youre completely correct youre comparing two policies youve got youve got compare effects one moment see know government focused purely covert deaths deaths including cancer deaths example sort myopic focus agree need consider effects would say trial different policies different cities know maybe would know mandatory vaccination liverpool voluntary vaccination manchester paid vaccination leeds know positively pay people vaccinated see rapid uptake best effect think trial different policies suppose already controversy different tiers would issue would worry also trialing something like point herd immunity think vaccine going contribute herd immunity slight issue dont really know whether theyre going stop transmission oxford vaccine hinted think undermines argent mandatory vaccination promote herd immunity test experiment scale would also bit worried terms public reaction yeah well another question want ask shall ask another one go next ill right everyone attacks personally dont personally think mandatory policy im giving argents think actually strongest argent mandatory vaccination one youve given one vaccine effective protect getting vaccinated dont need hurt immunity take qantas sort concern concern know protecting passengers crew qantas flights get vaccinated doesnt require get vaccinated protect vaccine effective response think well people wont able get vaccinated immune problems allergies etc vaccine doesnt work whatever know need protect people mean deal objection need protect people cant vaccinated agree point think perspective often put across see people pro-vaccine side people supporting vaccine actually making argent people cant vaccinated whos thinking rights health responsibility especially know compromised people new vaccine particular groups might tested yeah definitely agree think worry okay well maybe ill ask one question im interested samantha works andy pollard sort one trio gurus behind oxford vaccine isnt group worried sort public perception around safety know ive heard lot ordinary people know daughter example university students saying look new vaccine know gonna wait see know safe arent anti-vaxxers people genuine concerns safety rapid process andy group worried different measles measles around know decades know new kind vaccine new disease dont really understand yet worried people reluctant get vaccinated particular circstance think know safety key concern people normally main reason people opposed vaccination concerns safety know heightened new vaccine weve seen instances wouldnt speak rest group thinking safety vaccine im sure something theyre top priority list would would developing vaccine sorry let ask one last one whats happened hpv vaccine rolled daughters school think child fit children fits time said know vaccine implicated eventually know thought vaccine wasnt cause fit given youre going roll covert vaccine whole population people die time people predictably die get covert vaccine may difficult unravel whether death cur would occurred anyway related vaccine mean think public reassured cases predictably know illnesses deaths fitting normally occurs population level vaccine administered everyone isnt kind cause increased vaccine hesitancy concern yeah think government would respond reports adverse effects happening normal course action would investigate cause put pause vaccine campaign would happen examples see say japan responding reports adverse events hpv vaccine completely stopping vaccine country without confirming connection vaccine adverse events could see maybe right kind response gives impression problem vaccine even though confirmed gets reported also ban message goes across countries would worried reaction adverse events happening might connected vaccine okay go questions ill go order saw actually votes next ill take one votes one got votes daniel asks think done provide people right facts vaccine stem disinformation seems like one sam provide people vaccine stem disinformation yeah right yeah right facts vaccine stem disinformation yeah seeing lot disinformation misinformation online social media expect government health authorities proactive going spaces making sure theyre getting across positive messages vaccine showing benefits also addressing questions concerns safety answering questions people know worried new vaccine think cant dismissed think would easy lp queries people might misinformed ignorance need getting public health messages vaccine theyre safe music addressing peoples concerns okay peter archdale asks reconcile rights one individual refuse vaccine rights individuals society expect protected others taking protective measures including vaccination think good question think ill give brief answer depends level risk individual exposing people know extreme example somebody carrying gun take gun obviously gun analogy doesnt work one chance kill somebody vaccinated part answer depends effective vaccine protecting people close herd immunity paradoxically less effective vaccine less protect require people around us vaccinating question depend nature vaccine nature people affected many people already taking sam anything say question yeah think would put context vaccine risk certain individuals look mean personal view know shouldnt requiring young people take vaccine theyre extremely low risk chance year old dying covert less dying chickenpox chance somebody dying covert dying car accident year think argent prioritized prioritized incentivized even made mandatory older people risk becoming ill putting pressure nhs think disproportionality ages covert affects means difficult argue blanket mandatory policy im sure answers question think parallels diseases made mandatory diseases vaccine made mandatory ones higher risk cant see yeah think would difficult make argent across populations risk much less young people yeah mean like spanish flu killed million people affected ages smallpox affected ages ebola infectious covert would candidates mandatory vaccination think fact covert primarily lethal makes different diseases lets go another question sorry cant take interventions people asked questions didnt choose format thanks samantha please expand would favor mandatory vaccination exceptional cases mentioned eg qantas would many objections raise mandates larger scale apply smaller scales would reasons would justify mandating vaccination board plane keeping others safe apply plane ones know good point think still choice take another means transport really left provider decide whether something want dont worry public sentiment unless would affect balanced views see lot people wanting fly would indication change policy think gives responsibility individual companies individual parts society rather going across board martino bardelli asks vaccine manager one choose vaccine use well think safest effective vaccine would first candidate problem mrna vaccine five times expensive oxide vaccine would justice argent know resources may save lives overall cheaper vaccine used healthcare elsewhere improved think first point would look safety effectiveness sam view choose vaccine yeah think well safety effectiveness would also ease transport able get people arrangements health care system already put things place question five votes safety covert vaccine people autoimmune diseases im im know expert autoimmune diseases know answer sam wouldnt go lot detail know part trial protocols test populations diseases im sorry dont think either us probably best people answer question please explain herd immunity highly toxic topic uk want sam want want start one examples herd immunity concept get sufficient nbers sufficient nber people vaccinated immune population disease longer spreads contained even people arent vaccinated still protected disease essentially contained even eliminated think somebody mentioned something like measles need population immune order stop spreading covert lower somewhere percent actually paper consideration shows allowed und age group mix normally severely isolated would get hurt immunity six months pressure nhs weve far herd immunity much lower thought necessary anything add herd immunity yeah mean covet think something going learning time still quite uncharted territory knowing exactly herd immunity would also say important protecting vulnerable groups mentioned normally consideration vaccine policy finding herd immunity behaving quite important okay one four votes starting point vaccine mandatory oh moved sorry helen bedfords question wheres gone removed oh yeah sorry mean starting point vaccine mandatory could could affect important relationship health professional parent patient professional less willing answer questions concerns important look actual policies mandatory around world know fines example italy issued doctors doctor completely separate state institution issues penalty vaccinated argent interfere doctor-patient relationship think applies certain kinds mandatory vaccination know compulsory doctor administer would severely change doctor-patient relationship example australia child know child welfare agency simply withholds child benefit vaccination hasnt completed think doctor still willing answer questions concerns normal doctor-patient relationship shall go next one ruta samonskeit asks vaccine point half population wont effective would vaccine lets say one person vaccinated room nine people covert vaccinated well still benefit half population vaccinated particularly half vulnerable governments current plans administer healthcare workers people age age seven age . people likely elderly likely become severely ill likely require hospitalization medical treatment even able get uptake amongst elderly people age took would significant effect hopefully remove need lockdown partial effectiveness still worth going especially effective protecting vulnerable yes youd still protected youre vaccinating room nine people vaccine effective dont need low nbers vaccine effective sam anything add yeah also likely public health measures continuing quite could also play part controlling hopefully eliminating october yeah think vaccine going rolled relatively slowly going days need right away space getting first dose sand period youre immune bit longer think half population vaccinated measures might still impact okay levi asks protecting fine theory wont virus likely mutate less people vaccinated making vaccine possibly useless well im inclined think possibility sam know anything specific would say something vaccine teams working thinking happens virus mutates ive seen scientists saying something would able address especially types vaccine platforms used moment might able adapt vaccine like every year new vaccine okay val rossman asks four votes almost every country enthusiasm vaccine dropped surely affect uptake research done explain change attitude yeah wouldnt read much polls think weve seen announcements made work going explaining whats gone vaccine development making clear argents vaccine approved explaining benefits still going work going might see change wouldnt would concern wouldnt worry much small dips small changes polls okay well one id like professor savileski would lena would ethical fair moral make someone certain age someone whos paid taxes worn seat belts possibly good life overall healthy enjoying retirement vaccinated new vaccine come may one might rather adverse effects even bring health decline still unknown side effects might hit harder older people well know gave argent mandatory vaccination asked im actually libertarian think choice consideration would say older people likely go respiratory failure need hospitalization intensive care means resources arent available others think know balance either know need prepared lower priority candidate intensive care bed willing take vaccine know know lottery think argent know need protect nhs driven various lockdowns think argent weaker commonly made know think could prepared accept people make decisions vaccination behavior deal triaging level hospital admissions lets see heres one sam measles extremely contagious patrick mclean around vaccine coverage needed prevent outbreaks covert less infectious measles perhaps coverage required clearly changes marginal benefit convincing coercing unvaccinated take covered vaccine would government want enrage subset population meet target universal coverage may even matter yeah think says really polls people saying would take vaccine country really want make mandatory policy ring dont actually dont even know happen comes making decision vaccination polls could still convincingly rotten dont think would worth policy remainder say know moment enough vaccine lets say six months time production scales enough vaccine everyone know percent population chosen vaccination would move consider mandatory policy would like mandatory policies would certain areas travel think would way bringing vaccination stopping virus imported moving around think major issue dont think something across board like like would work okay heres colin asks successful reactions compulsory vaccinations children singapore sam would one think recent wont able say much dont think much research singapore finding people thinking compulsory vaccinations far know taught something talked recently enacted okay john asks believe takes approximately one year vaccine pharmaceutical becomes available public safety profile complete issue management vaccination limited certain groups healthcare personnel first responders essential workers expose public businesses well know think always new vaccine introduced ongoing monitoring rare unforeseen side effects typical trial know post surveillance quite period time may year maybe longer safety value judgment know safe drive miles hour well germans drive know miles hour australians drive miles hour question much risk accept isnt sort formula think issue isnt suddenly line bright line cross safe always youre getting confident fewer fewer risks point decide whether jp water dont sam something say yeah argent vaccine theyre safe nothing safe think risks getting disease whether think benefit vaccination outweighs risks clara oxendine school says wood setting scheme similar nus card covert vaccine passport get discounts shops travel encourage vaccination rather mandatory well actually think case given novel vaccine personally think incentivization even payment better way accelerate vaccine uptake making mandatory indeed know immunity passports version enabling travel freely go different venues wear mask perhaps think sorts incentive schemes going better punishments something controversial vaccine nobody seems seriously considering incentivization payment sam could say anything started immunity passports slightly kind way showing weve vaccinated least communicate gp something talked need kind docentation let people know youve vaccinated whether want attach certain benefits discussion suppose people people might worried idea id cards didnt go didnt go well uk see people idea status like whether youve immunized official docentation something yet see play among three cs moniker asks could uk better confidence transparency presentation data optimal support confidence im going hand sam want say im confident government government told us british beef safe government told us weapons mass destruction iraq government told us buy diesel vehicles good environment im sort understand peoples skepticism government sam think address agree also dont think really government telling us take vaccine mean tell us take vaccine tend trust healthcare providers tend trust scientists maybe people society community leaders people need behind vaccinations also explaining safety efficacy vaccine really dominant politicians okay let see spotted others high hi julian let know last question evening okay heres question sam going get vaccinated soon available inga yeah think well im going ill tell antibodies covert havent seen one actually looked cdc today said cant provide advice people previously covert whether vaccinated think absolutely striking discussion lot nhs healthcare workers covert supposed getting vaccine dont know policy people five million people uk cobra . think yet another example failure communicate instill confidence would answer ill wait see evidence shows people whove actually okay well thank much sam audience im sorry couldnt get questions im sorry hasnt exactly like live event appreciate interesting questions also reasonable discussion weve thank part debate good night good night everyone
